PROGRAM 1
*********
The function below takes a string as an argument. The function should return a dictionary where the keys are the character in the string, and the corresponding values are how many of each character is in that message.
The function should not be case sensitive. (you can user the .lower() or .casefold() methods)

Hint 1: A blank dictionary to start is helpful.
Hint 2: Looping through all characters with a for loops will be helpful.
Hint 3: You will need to use <dictionary>.setdefault(char, 0) for characters that are not yet keys in the dictionary.

EXAMPLE OF WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN WHEN THIS RUNS:

charcount("The thing.")
--> returns {'t': 2, 'h': 2, 'e': 1, ' ': 1, 'i': 1, 'n': 1, 'g': 1, '.': 1}
'''

def charcount(message):
  pass  # delete this line when you start writing your code
